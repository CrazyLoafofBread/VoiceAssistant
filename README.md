# VoiceAssistant
A voice assistant using python

For this project I used those libraries:
SpeechRecognition
wikipedia
pyjokes
datetime
pyttsx3(Python text to speech)
subprocess

This project is a "simple" voice assistant

you can add your own commands by simply adding:
if "put your word here" in commands:
  ...
 else:
  waittobecalled()
 
if you want him to open an app, you have to use subprocess library, specifically subprocess.call(""), and put the path, inside the brackets, of the app that you want your assistant to open.
 
 You can make any changes you want, add or remove feature
